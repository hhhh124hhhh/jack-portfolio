# AI Genie 3 Game Prompts

## Overview

This skill provides specialized prompt patterns and examples for creating AI video games using Google's Genie 3. It transforms natural language descriptions into playable game experiences through effective prompt engineering.

## Prompt Patterns

### Core Structure

Effective Genie 3 prompts follow this structure:

```
[Character description] has to [action] through [environment that defies logic], [visual elements/effects]
```

**Key elements:**
1. **Character**: Who is the protagonist? (e.g., "French woman", "Robot", "Space explorer")
2. **Action**: What is the core gameplay? (e.g., "climb through", "navigate", "survive")
3. **Environment**: Where does it take place? Emphasize surreal/impossible physics
4. **Visual effects**: What makes it visually interesting?

### Successful Examples

#### Example 1: Surreal Adventure
**Prompt**: "French woman has to climb through a word that defies logic, flying objects everywhere"

**Statistics**:

- Likes: 6,450
- Retweets: 252
- Bookmarks: 1,124

**Why it works**:
- Clear protagonist: "French woman"
- Definitive action: "climb through"
- Surreal environment: "word that defies logic"
- Dynamic visuals: "flying objects everywhere"

#### Example 2: Gravity-Defying Platformer
**Prompt**: "Robot must jump across floating islands that rearrange themselves in the sky, waterfalls flowing upward"

**Why it works**:
- Specific character: "Robot"
- Clear action: "jump across"
- Impossible physics: "floating islands that rearrange"
- Visual twist: "waterfalls flowing upward"

## Prompt Templates

### Template 1: Adventure Exploration
```
[Character] has to [traverse/exploration verb] through [surreal environment], [unexpected phenomena] everywhere
```

**Examples**:
- "Cyberpunk hacker has to sneak through a digital maze that shifts reality, neon lights materializing everywhere"
- "Medieval knight must quest through a forest made of crystal, animals floating upside down"

### Template 2: Survival Challenge
```
[Character] needs to survive in [impossible setting], [dangerous elements] appearing randomly
```

**Examples**:
- "Astronaut needs to survive on a planet made of lava, ice storms appearing randomly"
- "Submarine captain must navigate through a sea of glass, jellyfish made of light"

### Template 3: Puzzle Solver
```
[Character] solves [type of puzzles] by [unusual method], in a world where [impossible rules]
```

**Examples**:
- "Detective solves crimes by entering paintings, in a world where art becomes reality"
- "Wizard riddles doors by singing backwards, in a castle where physics follows music"

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Characters
✅ **Good**: "French woman", "Steampunk detective", "Cyberpunk samurai"
❌ **Bad**: "Someone", "A person", "Character"

### 2. Emphasize the Impossible
✅ **Good**: "word that defies logic", "waterfalls flowing upward", "floating islands that rearrange"
❌ **Bad**: "strange place", "weird world", "unusual environment"

### 3. Include Dynamic Visuals
✅ **Good**: "flying objects everywhere", "neon lights materializing", "jellyfish made of light"
❌ **Bad**: "some effects", "interesting visuals", "cool stuff"

### 4. Keep Prompts Concise
- 15-30 words total
- Focus on 3-4 key elements
- Avoid overly complex descriptions

## Common Themes

Explore these established themes for consistent results:

- **Gravity manipulation**: Objects falling up, sideways, or in patterns
- **Reality distortion**: Textures changing, dimensions shifting, physics breaking
- **Element mixing**: Fire underwater, ice volcanoes, crystal forests
- **Time/space bending**: Loops, portals, impossible geometry
- **Surreal biology**: Plants that move, animals made of light, hybrid creatures

## Testing Your Prompts

Before finalizing a prompt, ask:

1. **Is the character clear?** Can I visualize them immediately?
2. **Is the action specific?** Do I know what gameplay looks like?
3. **Is the environment impossible?** Does it defy normal physics/logic?
4. **Are there dynamic visuals?** What will players see moving/changing?
5. **Is it concise?** Can it be read in under 10 seconds?
