```
Most high profile work income across seems to be from people with PhDs, either in academia or industry. There's also a hiring bias towards formal degrees. 

There has been a surplus of good quality online learning material and guides about choosing the right books, etc, that a committed and disciplined person can self learn a significant amount. 

It sounds good in principle, but has it happened in practice? Are there people with basically a BS/MS in CS or engineering who self taught themselves all the math and ML theory, and went on to build fundamentally new things or made significant contributions to this field? 

More personally, I fall in this bucket, and while I'm making good progress with the math, I'd like to know, based on examples of others, how far I can actually go. If self teaching and laboring through a lot of material will be worth it.
