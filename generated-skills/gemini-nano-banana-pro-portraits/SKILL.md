## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific and Detailed
- Use precise descriptions: "messy high ponytail" not "updo"
- Include textures: "sweaty", "glistening", "glossy", "matte"
- Mention visible details: "visible pores", "slight flush", "subtle creases"

### 2. Match Lighting to Mood
- Fitness scenes: Harsher, more dramatic lighting
- Fashion: Controlled, studio lighting
- Casual: Natural, soft lighting

### 3. Control Depth of Field
- f/1.2-2.8: Creamy bokeh, dreamy backgrounds
- f/4.0-5.6: Moderate depth, some background detail
- f/8.0-11: Sharp throughout, environmental portraits

### 4. Include Environmental Context
- Ground subjects in specific locations
- Add realistic background elements
- Describe flooring and surfaces

### 5. Use Technical Terminology
- "DSLR", "mirrorless", "85mm portrait lens"
- "ray tracing", "subsurface scattering", "volumetric lighting"
- "Unreal Engine 5", "Octane Render", "HDRI lighting"

## Common Styles

### Fitness Photography

## Testing Your Configurations

Before generating, verify:

1. **JSON is valid**: Check for missing commas, brackets
2. **All sections filled**: Don't leave required fields empty
3. **Consistent details**: Lighting should match mood, apparel matches setting
4. **Realistic specifications**: Camera settings should be plausible
5. **Complete narrative**: The config should tell a coherent story
