I have a feeling there must be an obvious answer here. I just came across gaussian process here:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471220303641

From my understanding, a model that provides a prediction with an uncertainty estimate (that is properly tuned/calibrated for OOD) is immensely useful for the enrichment of results via an acquisition function from screening (for example over the drug perturbation space in a given cell line). 

In that paper, they suggest a hybrid approach of GP + MLP. \*what drawbacks would this have, other than a slightly higher MSE?\* 

Although this is not what I'm going for, another application is continued learning:

Their paper doesn't train a highly general drug-drug synergy model, but certianly shows that uncertainty works in practice.

I've implemented (deep) ensemble learning before, but this seems more practical than having to train 5 identical models at
