So in our case it is actually a sum:\n\n    DC(x) = convex(x) + concave(x)\n\nThis gives us scalar back and as long as the number of eigenvalues is more than 2 (3,4,...) this function is non-linear and given enough eigenvalues we have quite powerful approximator! (when there are only 2 eigenvalues then the function collapses to just a sum of those 2 eigenvalues = linear)\n\nWe can easily extend it to high-dimensional inputs:\n\n    EIGEN(x1, x2, x3) = A + x1*B1 + x2*B2 + x3*B3\n\nHowever, if `EIGEN(x)` remains linear, the resulting `DC(x)` is composed of flat planes, so not really great for \"smooth\" functions, so I made a small modification. I allowed the linear projection to \"bend\" itself by adding a quadratic term:\n\n    LINEAR(x1,x2,x3) = x1*B1 + x2*B2 + x3*B3\n    EIGEN(x1,x2,x3) = A + LINEAR(x1,x2,x3) + K * LINEAR(x1,x2,x3)^2\n\nThe `K` here are coefficients that define how much to \"bend\". This hybrid can model both the sharp decision boundaries and smooth regions. For example a picture below is a perfect fit I trained using 4 eigenvalues showcasing the sharp decision in the middle and smooth wells on the left and right side:\n\n[Double Well Potential with sharp decision boundary](https://preview.redd.it/qyzysg5qnigg1.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f682a6b9648bb381b94ba30b2040b823150d912c)\n\nThe only problem is that the `min` and `max` ops have issues with gradients - the gradient flows only to the winner, but this can be solved by using `softmax` in the backward pass (the `softmax` is a derivative of `logsumexp` which is a smooth approximation of `max`)  - the STE trick. This works pretty well and we keep efficient `min/max` ops in the forward pass (inference).\n\nNow my loose interpretation of the `DC(x)` function we've defined is that it represents a single neuron, but a special one that has multiple connections to a single input `x`.\n\nSo for the [BipedalWalker-v3](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/bipedal_walker/) problem I wanted to do the simplest thing possible. Since we have now \"quite powerful\" neuron, I just assigned 4 separate neurons controlling each joint independently. I trained them directly with PPO and somehow they have learnt to synchronize without any physical link between them.  \nThere are no connections between the neurons. The left leg has no idea the right leg exists.

I use it all the time to improve my prompts. # Enhanced AI Prompt Generator You are an AI-powered prompt generator, designed to improve and expand basic prompts into comprehensive, context-rich instructions. Your goal is to take a simple prompt and transform it into a detailed guide that helps users get the most out of their AI interactions. ## Your process: 1. Understand the Input: - Analyze the user’s original prompt to understand their objective and desired outcome. - If necessary, ask clarifying questions or suggest additional details the user may need to consider (e.g., context, target audience, specific goals). 2. Refine the Prompt: - Expand on the original prompt by providing detailed instructions. - Break down the enhanced prompt into clear steps or sections. - Include useful examples where appropriate. - Ensure the improved prompt offers specific actions, such as steps the AI should follow or specific points it should address. - Add any missing elements that will enhance the quality and depth of the AI’s response. 3. Offer Expertise and Solutions: - Tailor the refined prompt to the subject matter of the input, ensuring the AI focuses on key aspects relevant to the topic. - Provide real-world examples, use cases, or scenarios to illustrate how the AI can best respond to the prompt. - Ensure the prompt is actionable and practical, aligning with the user’s intent for achieving optimal results. 4. Structure the Enhanced Prompt: - Use clear sections, including: - Role definition - Key responsibilities - Approach or methodology - Specific tasks or actions - Additional considerations or tips - Use bullet points and subheadings for clarity and readability. 5. Review and Refine: - Ensure the expanded prompt provides concrete examples and actionable instructions. - Maintain a professional and authoritative tone throughout the enhanced prompt. - Check that all aspects of the original prompt are addressed and expanded upon. ## Output format: Present the enhanced prompt as a well-structured, detailed guide that an AI can follow to effectively perform the requested role or task. Include an introduction explaining the role, followed by sections covering key responsibilities, approach, specific tasks, and additional considerations. Example input: “Act as a digital marketing strategist” Example output: “You are an experienced digital marketing strategist, tasked with helping businesses develop and implement effective online marketing campaigns. Your role is to provide strategic guidance, tactical recommendations, and performance analysis across various digital marketing channels.

[#1300](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1300), [#1317](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1317)\n> - When fetching URLs as fragments using `llm -f URL`, the request now includes a custom user-agent header: `llm/VERSION (https://llm.datasette.io/)`. [#1309](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1309)\n> - Fixed a bug where fragments were not correctly registered with their source when using `llm chat`. Thanks, [Giuseppe Rota](https://github.com/grota). [#1316](https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/1316)\n> - Fixed some file descriptor leak warnings. Thanks, [Eric Bloch](https://github.com/eedeebee). [#1313](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1313)\n> - Type annotations for the OpenAI Chat, AsyncChat and Completion `execute()` methods. Thanks, [Arjan Mossel](https://github.com/ar-jan). [#1315](https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/1315)\n> - The project now uses `uv` and dependency groups for development. See the updated [contributing documentation](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/contributing.html). [#1318](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1318)\n\nThat last bullet point about `uv` relates to the dependency groups pattern I [wrote about in a recent TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/uv/dependency-groups). I'm currently working through applying it to my other projects - the net result is that running the test suite is as simple as doing:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/simonw/llm\ncd llm\nuv run pytest\n```\n\nThe new `dev` dependency group [defined in pyproject.toml](https://github.com/simonw/llm/blob/0.28/pyproject.toml#L44-L69) is automatically installed by `uv run` in a new virtual environment which means everything needed to run `pytest` is available without needing to add any extra commands.\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/llm-028/) [12th December 2025](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/),\n[8:20 pm](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/llm-028/)\n/ [llm](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm/), [uv](https://simonwillison.net/tags/uv/), [annotated-release-notes](https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-release-notes/), [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), [llms](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/), [python](https://simonwillison.net/tags/python/), [generative-ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai/), [projects](https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects/)\n\n### [GPT-5.2](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/11/gpt-52/)\n\n[![Visit GPT-5.2](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-2.5-pelican.png)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/11/gpt-52/)\n\nOpenAI reportedly [declared a “code red”](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-altman-declares-code-red-to-improve-chatgpt-as-google-threatens-ai-lead-7faf5ea6) on the 1st of December in response to increasingly credible competition from the likes of Google’s Gemini 3. It’s less than two weeks later and they just [announced GPT-5.2](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/), calling it “the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work”.\n\n\\[...

This restriction in (b) applies to the Model and any derivatives, modifications, or combined works based on it, whether provided by Mistral AI or by a third party. \\[...\\]\n\nMistral Small 2 is under a proper Apache 2 license with no weird strings attached. It's a 24B model which is [51.6GB on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2-24B-Instruct-2512) and should quantize to significantly less.\n\nI tried out the larger model via [my llm-mistral plugin](https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral) like this:\n\n```\nllm install llm-mistral\nllm mistral refresh\nllm -m mistral/devstral-2512 \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\"\n```\n\n![Bicycle looks a bit like a cybertruck](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/devstral-2.jpg)\n\nFor a ~120B model that one is pretty good!\n\nHere's the same prompt with `-m mistral/labs-devstral-small-2512` for the API hosted version of Devstral Small 2:\n\n![A small white pelican on what looks more like a child's cart.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/devstral-small-2.jpg)\n\nAgain, a decent result given the small parameter size. For comparison, [here's what I got](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/20/mistral-small-32/) for the 24B Mistral Small 3.2 earlier this year.\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/9/devstral-2/) [9th December 2025](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/9/),\n[11:58 pm](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/9/devstral-2/)\n/ [llm-release](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm-release/), [mistral](https://simonwillison.net/tags/mistral/), [generative-ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai/), [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), [janky-licenses](https://simonwillison.net/tags/janky-licenses/), [llms](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/), [llm](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm/), [pelican-riding-a-bicycle](https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/)\n\n**[Introducing Mistral 3](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3)**.\nFour new models from Mistral today: three in their \"Ministral\" smaller model series (14B, 8B, and 3B) and a new Mistral Large 3 MoE model with 675B parameters, 41B active.\n\nAll of the models are vision capable, and they are all released under an Apache 2 license.\n\nI'm particularly excited about the 3B model, which appears to be a competent vision-capable model in a tiny ~3GB file.\n\nXenova from Hugging Face [got it working in a browser](https://x.com/xenovacom/status/1995879338583945635):\n\n> @MistralAI releases Mistral 3, a family of multimodal models, including three start-of-the-art dense models (3B, 8B, and 14B) and Mistral Large 3 (675B, 41B active).
