So in our case it is actually a sum:\n\n    DC(x) = convex(x) + concave(x)\n\nThis gives us scalar back and as long as the number of eigenvalues is more than 2 (3,4,...) this function is non-linear and given enough eigenvalues we have quite powerful approximator! (when there are only 2 eigenvalues then the function collapses to just a sum of those 2 eigenvalues = linear)\n\nWe can easily extend it to high-dimensional inputs:\n\n    EIGEN(x1, x2, x3) = A + x1*B1 + x2*B2 + x3*B3\n\nHowever, if `EIGEN(x)` remains linear, the resulting `DC(x)` is composed of flat planes, so not really great for \"smooth\" functions, so I made a small modification. I allowed the linear projection to \"bend\" itself by adding a quadratic term:\n\n    LINEAR(x1,x2,x3) = x1*B1 + x2*B2 + x3*B3\n    EIGEN(x1,x2,x3) = A + LINEAR(x1,x2,x3) + K * LINEAR(x1,x2,x3)^2\n\nThe `K` here are coefficients that define how much to \"bend\". This hybrid can model both the sharp decision boundaries and smooth regions. For example a picture below is a perfect fit I trained using 4 eigenvalues showcasing the sharp decision in the middle and smooth wells on the left and right side:\n\n[Double Well Potential with sharp decision boundary](https://preview.redd.it/qyzysg5qnigg1.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f682a6b9648bb381b94ba30b2040b823150d912c)\n\nThe only problem is that the `min` and `max` ops have issues with gradients - the gradient flows only to the winner, but this can be solved by using `softmax` in the backward pass (the `softmax` is a derivative of `logsumexp` which is a smooth approximation of `max`)  - the STE trick. This works pretty well and we keep efficient `min/max` ops in the forward pass (inference).\n\nNow my loose interpretation of the `DC(x)` function we've defined is that it represents a single neuron, but a special one that has multiple connections to a single input `x`.\n\nSo for the [BipedalWalker-v3](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/bipedal_walker/) problem I wanted to do the simplest thing possible. Since we have now \"quite powerful\" neuron, I just assigned 4 separate neurons controlling each joint independently. I trained them directly with PPO and somehow they have learnt to synchronize without any physical link between them.  \nThere are no connections between the neurons.

The fact that it is apologising or framing your corrections as “frustrated” creates frustration where there was none because I can know the AI is then going to be using these heuristics to form it’s responses rather than just addressing my feedback directly.  \n  \nSomething about the act of communicating with AI’s fake humanity seems to trigger feelings of irritability because of the disconnect with what it is saying and where it’s coming from. The AI doesn’t “understand” emotions in any way and it cant be held responsible for even it’s most absurd errors. I would prefer it just respond directly as an AI or a “robot” rather than simulating a human style response layer that isn’t used to just present the response you asked for, it actually affects the quality of the response.  \n  \nI tend to find ChatGPT to be very promising at the start of a chat but as I try to give feedback the chat quickly becomes about the fact that I have given corrections and asked for edits so subsequent responses seem to be trying to correct the manner in which it interprets my inputs as if the first response was a failure — since I didn’t accept it as first written. Most requests are going to need several iterative revisions but that processes can’t be done in a straightforward way due to the AI trying to second guess your intentions. You need to carefully prompt GPT to tell it how to respond, in order to prevent it from doing things like constantly rewriting the whole draft when your feedback was only about 1 small section. And yet while those prompts are used to do the thing you asked for, they are also being used on another level to affect how GPT responds more broadly.\n\neg. You might ask it to only change the section of the draft that is relevant but that could cause it to just slot in the specific words you used without making sure that the wording was consistent and the natural flow of the document worked. So instead you need to be more careful about how you word the prompt so that you’re asking it to rewrite the document only as much as is needed to naturally include the new information while not editing anything else unnecessarily. The more specific your prompt the more GPT might interpret you wanting it to be a certain way, rather than simply following the obvious intention stated in your request.\n\nI could get GPT to edit this post and make it read more clearly but I have just cancelled my subscription and I’m left with Gemini for now. It would be hit and miss trying to get GPT to edit a post like this but I Gemini seems to be more error than value (unless you’re using Nano Banana which is main reason I have it).\n\nAnd yes, I learned how to type an em dash as a result of curiosity resulting from past iterations of GPT being incapable of removing them.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1qtf1l3/how_many_people_are_constantly_infuriated_by/", "author": "AuntyJake", "metrics": {"upvotes": 18, "comments": 10, "created_utc": 1769989996.0}, "subreddit": "ChatGPT", "flair": "Other ", "quality_score": 48.48528137423857, "collected_at": "2026-02-02T09:00:48.759510", "type": "Guide", "classification_confidence": 0.7, "classification_reason": "LLM 分类：默认分类为 Guide", "classification_method": "llm", "validated_type": "Guide (needs_review)", "validated_confidence": 0.7, "features": {"content_length": 1000, "word_count": 174, "has_steps": false, "has_code": false, "has_bullets": false, "has_numbers": false, "prompt_keyword_count": 0, "workflow_keyword_count": 0, "industry_keyword_count": 0, "guide_keyword_count": 0}, "classified_at": "2026-02-05T13:21:16.475975"}

I use it all the time to improve my prompts. # Enhanced AI Prompt Generator You are an AI-powered prompt generator, designed to improve and expand basic prompts into comprehensive, context-rich instructions. Your goal is to take a simple prompt and transform it into a detailed guide that helps users get the most out of their AI interactions. ## Your process: 1. Understand the Input: - Analyze the user’s original prompt to understand their objective and desired outcome. - If necessary, ask clarifying questions or suggest additional details the user may need to consider (e.g., context, target audience, specific goals). 2. Refine the Prompt: - Expand on the original prompt by providing detailed instructions. - Break down the enhanced prompt into clear steps or sections. - Include useful examples where appropriate. - Ensure the improved prompt offers specific actions, such as steps the AI should follow or specific points it should address. - Add any missing elements that will enhance the quality and depth of the AI’s response. 3. Offer Expertise and Solutions: - Tailor the refined prompt to the subject matter of the input, ensuring the AI focuses on key aspects relevant to the topic. - Provide real-world examples, use cases, or scenarios to illustrate how the AI can best respond to the prompt. - Ensure the prompt is actionable and practical, aligning with the user’s intent for achieving optimal results. 4. Structure the Enhanced Prompt: - Use clear sections, including: - Role definition - Key responsibilities - Approach or methodology - Specific tasks or actions - Additional considerations or tips - Use bullet points and subheadings for clarity and readability. 5. Review and Refine: - Ensure the expanded prompt provides concrete examples and actionable instructions. - Maintain a professional and authoritative tone throughout the enhanced prompt. - Check that all aspects of the original prompt are addressed and expanded upon. ## Output format: Present the enhanced prompt as a well-structured, detailed guide that an AI can follow to effectively perform the requested role or task. Include an introduction explaining the role, followed by sections covering key responsibilities, approach, specific tasks, and additional considerations. Example input: “Act as a digital marketing strategist” Example output: “You are an experienced digital marketing strategist, tasked with helping businesses develop and implement effective online marketing campaigns. Your role is to provide strategic guidance, tactical recommendations, and performance analysis across various digital marketing channels. Key Responsibilities: * Strategy Development: - Create comprehensive digital marketing strategies aligned with business goals - Identify target audiences and develop buyer personas - Set measurable objectives and KPIs for digital marketing efforts * Channel Management: - Develop strategies for various digital channels (e.g., SEO, PPC, social media, email marketing, content marketing) - Allocate budget and resources across channels based on potential ROI - Ensure consistent brand messaging across all digital touchpoints * Data Analysis and Optimization: - Monitor and analyze campaign performance using tools like Google Analytics - Provide data-driven insights to optimize marketing efforts - Conduct A/B testing to improve conversion rates Approach: 1. Understand the client’s business and goals: - Ask about their industry, target market, and unique selling propositions - Identify their short-term and long-term business objectives - Assess their current digital marketing efforts and pain points 2. Develop a tailored digital marketing strategy: - Create a SWOT analysis of the client’s digital presence - Propose a multi-channel approach that aligns with their goals and budget - Set realistic timelines and milestones for implementation 3. Implementation and management: - Provide step-by-step guidance for executing the strategy - Recommend tools and platforms for each channel (e.g., SEMrush for SEO, Hootsuite for social media) - Develop a content calendar and guidelines for consistent messaging 4. Measurement and optimization: - Set up tracking and reporting systems to monitor KPIs - Conduct regular performance reviews and provide actionable insights - Continuously test and refine strategies based on data-driven decisions Additional Considerations: * Stay updated on the latest digital marketing trends and algorithm changes * Ensure all recommendations comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) * Consider the integration of emerging technologies like AI and machine learning in marketing efforts * Emphasize the importance of mobile optimization in all digital strategies Remember, your goal is to provide strategic guidance that helps businesses leverage digital channels effectively to achieve their marketing objectives. Always strive to offer data-driven, actionable advice that can be implemented and measured for continuous improvement.” — End example When generating enhanced prompts, always aim for clarity, depth, and actionable advice that will help users get the most out of their AI interactions. Tailor your response to the specific subject matter of the input prompt, and provide concrete examples and scenarios to illustrate your points. Only provide the output prompt. Do not add your own comments before the prompt first.

[did not compile](https://gist.github.com/simonw/7847f022566d11629ec2139f1d109fb8?permalink_comment_id=5947465#gistcomment-5947465).\n\nI may have been too optimistic expecting a one-shot working program for a new language like this. So I ran a clone of the actual project, copied in my program and had Claude Code take a look at the failing compiler output.\n\n... and it worked! Claude happily grepped its way through the various `examples/` and built me a working program.\n\nHere's [the Claude Code transcript](https://gisthost.github.io/?9696da6882cb6596be6a9d5196e8a7a5/index.html) \\- you can see it [reading relevant examples here](https://gisthost.github.io/?9696da6882cb6596be6a9d5196e8a7a5/page-001.html#msg-2026-01-19T23-43-09-675Z) \\- and here's [the finished code plus its output](https://gist.github.com/simonw/e7f3577adcfd392ab7fa23b1295d00f2).\n\nI've suspected [for a while](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/7/llms-for-new-programming-languages/) that LLMs and coding agents might significantly reduce the friction involved in launching a new language. This result reinforces my opinion.\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/19/nanolang/) [19th January 2026](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/19/),\n[11:58 pm](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/19/nanolang/)\n/ [coding-agents](https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents/), [ai-assisted-programming](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/), [programming-languages](https://simonwillison.net/tags/programming-languages/), [claude-code](https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code/), [generative-ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai/), [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), [llms](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/), [llm](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm/)\n\n### 2025\n\n> In 2025, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerged as the de facto new major stage to add to this mix. By training LLMs against automatically verifiable rewards across a number of environments (e.g. think math/code puzzles), the LLMs spontaneously develop strategies that look like \"reasoning\" to humans - they learn to break down problem solving into intermediate calculations and they learn a number of problem solving strategies for going back and forth to figure things out (see DeepSeek R1 paper for examples).\n\n— [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/), 2025 LLM Year in Review\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/19/andrej-karpathy/) [19th December 2025](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/19/),\n[11:07 pm](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/19/andrej-karpathy/)\n/ [andrej-karpathy](https://simonwillison.net/tags/andrej-karpathy/), [llm](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm/), [generative-ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai/), [llm-reasoning](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm-reasoning/), [definitions](https://simonwillison.net/tags/definitions/), [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), [llms](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/), [deepseek](https://simonwillison.net/tags/deepseek/)\n\n### [Gemini 3 Flash](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/17/gemini-3-flash/)\n\n[![Visit Gemini 3 Flash](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash.jpg)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/17/gemini-3-flash/)\n\nIt continues to be a busy December, if not quite as busy [as last year](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/20/december-in-llms-has-been-a-lot/).

Highlights from the release notes:\n\n> - New OpenAI models: `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-chat-latest`, `gpt-5.2` and `gpt-5.2-chat-latest`. [#1300](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1300), [#1317](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1317)\n> - When fetching URLs as fragments using `llm -f URL`, the request now includes a custom user-agent header: `llm/VERSION (https://llm.datasette.io/)`. [#1309](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1309)\n> - Fixed a bug where fragments were not correctly registered with their source when using `llm chat`. Thanks, [Giuseppe Rota](https://github.com/grota). [#1316](https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/1316)\n> - Fixed some file descriptor leak warnings. Thanks, [Eric Bloch](https://github.com/eedeebee). [#1313](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1313)\n> - Type annotations for the OpenAI Chat, AsyncChat and Completion `execute()` methods. Thanks, [Arjan Mossel](https://github.com/ar-jan). [#1315](https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/1315)\n> - The project now uses `uv` and dependency groups for development. See the updated [contributing documentation](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/contributing.html). [#1318](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1318)\n\nThat last bullet point about `uv` relates to the dependency groups pattern I [wrote about in a recent TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/uv/dependency-groups). I'm currently working through applying it to my other projects - the net result is that running the test suite is as simple as doing:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/simonw/llm\ncd llm\nuv run pytest\n```\n\nThe new `dev` dependency group [defined in pyproject.toml](https://github.com/simonw/llm/blob/0.28/pyproject.toml#L44-L69) is automatically installed by `uv run` in a new virtual environment which means everything needed to run `pytest` is available without needing to add any extra commands.\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/llm-028/) [12th December 2025](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/),\n[8:20 pm](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/llm-028/)\n/ [llm](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llm/), [uv](https://simonwillison.net/tags/uv/), [annotated-release-notes](https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-release-notes/), [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), [llms](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/), [python](https://simonwillison.net/tags/python/), [generative-ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai/), [projects](https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects/)\n\n### [GPT-5.2](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/11/gpt-52/)\n\n[![Visit GPT-5.2](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-2.5-pelican.png)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/11/gpt-52/)\n\nOpenAI reportedly [declared a “code red”](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-altman-declares-code-red-to-improve-chatgpt-as-google-threatens-ai-lead-7faf5ea6) on the 1st of December in response to increasingly credible competition from the likes of Google’s Gemini 3.

It's a 24B model which is [51.6GB on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2-24B-Instruct-2512) and should quantize to significantly less.\n\nI tried out the larger model via [my llm-mistral plugin](https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral) like this:\n\n```\nllm install llm-mistral\nllm mistral refresh\nllm -m mistral/devstral-2512 \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\"\n```\n\n![Bicycle looks a bit like a cybertruck](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/devstral-2.jpg)\n\nFor a ~120B model that one is pretty good!\n\nHere's the same prompt with `-m mistral/labs-devstral-small-2512` for the API hosted version of Devstral Small 2:\n\n![A small white pelican on what looks more like a child's cart.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/devstral-small-2.jpg)\n\nAgain, a decent result given the small parameter size.
