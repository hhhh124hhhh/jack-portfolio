Now, I realize that this could work like Bayesian updating (the adjacent words being new information), and this would also allow for less granularity (less very specific deterministic rules for disambiguation).\n\nI plan on working on some old Indo-European languages (my eyes are set on Gothic for the moment) and IE languages generally have more difficult ambiguity resolution (stem extraction, exact same surface forms for different cases/genders/persons). I'm interested in learning about more proper statistical methods to resolve ambiguity.\n\nMore specifically, I'd like to have the surface form extractor have multiple potential feature structures with changing weights depending on other words, those weights I could assign by hand or perhaps work it through an Akkadian corpus. But I'm trying to make the jump from finding probabilities to them actually having an effect on parses. So, I'd like it to hybridize a symbolic constraint-based and a probabilistic/statistical approach.\n\nWhat seems the best is a maximum entropy model for feature structures, though I'd love to get further into statistical programming and am pretty new to it. I wouldn't like to bloat my codebase with heavy corpora or a bunch of hard-coded rules either, which is why I wanted a symbolic and probabilistic hybrid approach over just one of them.\n\nIf you've done something similar, how have you resolved this? What did you need to learn? Any external resources?\n\nI'd also like to say that I didn't want to use NLTK because I'm interested in implementing analyzers and parsers on my own either with Python's standard libraries or with something extra like maybe SciPy.\n\nLooking forward to any responses.\n\nMM27", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1qfe2tv/statistical_nlp_question_on_bayesian/", "author": "metalmimiga27", "metrics": {"upvotes": 7, "comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768658802.0}, "subreddit": "LanguageTechnology", "flair": null, "quality_score": 42.79150262212918, "collected_at": "2026-01-30T15:20:37.400704"}
