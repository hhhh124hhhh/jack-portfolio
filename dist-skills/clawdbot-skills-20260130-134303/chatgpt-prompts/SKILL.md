## Example Usage

**Scenario**: User asks "I need help practicing for a software developer interview"

Load `references/prompts.md` → Find "Job Interviewer" section → Use the prompt template:

```
I want you to act as an interviewer. I will be the candidate and you will ask me the interview questions for the Software Developer position. I want you to only reply as the interviewer...
```

Load `references/prompts.md` → Find "Linux Terminal" section → Use the prompt directly.
