## Resume Sections

### Essential Sections

## Experience Writing Tips

Use the **STAR Method** for bullet points:
- **Situation**: What was the context?
- **Task**: What needed to be done?
- **Action**: What did you do?
- **Result**: What was the outcome?

**Example Bad:** "Worked on improving website performance"

**Example Good:** "Optimized website performance by implementing lazy loading and CDN, reducing page load time by 40% and increasing user retention by 25%"

## ATS Optimization Tips

1. **Use Keywords**: Include words from job description
2. **Simple Format**: Avoid tables, graphics, fancy fonts
3. **Standard Headings**: Use "Experience", "Education", "Skills"
4. **File Format**: Save as .docx or .pdf
5. **Contact Info**: Put in header, not in body

## Cover Letter Structure

1. **Header**: Your contact info
2. **Salutation**: "Dear Hiring Manager" or specific name
3. **Opening**: State position and why you're interested
4. **Body Paragraph 1**: Highlight relevant experience
5. **Body Paragraph 2**: Show company knowledge and fit
6. **Closing**: Call to action and thank you

## LinkedIn Optimization

### Profile Sections
- **Headline**: Job title + key skills (e.g., "Software Engineer | Python | Machine Learning")
- **About**: 2-3 paragraph professional summary
- **Experience**: Copy from resume but more conversational
- **Skills**: Add all relevant skills, endorse others
- **Recommendations**: Get 2-3 recommendations

### Keywords
- Include industry-specific terms
- Add location preferences
- Mention tools and technologies
- Highlight achievements with numbers

## Tailoring for Specific Roles

### For Tech Roles
- Emphasize: technologies, frameworks, projects
- Include: GitHub links, technical achievements
- Keywords: programming languages, tools, methodologies

- Emphasize: metrics, leadership, growth
- Include: achievements with $ and % impact
- Keywords: strategy, growth, leadership, metrics

### For Creative Roles
- Emphasize: portfolio, creative projects
- Include: links to work, design samples
- Keywords: design tools, creative process, portfolio

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Generic Resume**: Tailor to each position
2. **Typos**: Proofread multiple times
3. **Unprofessional Email**: Use firstname.lastname@gmail.com
4. **Missing Achievements**: Focus on results, not just duties
5. **Too Long**: Keep resume to 1-2 pages

## When to Load Reference Files

Load `references/resume-templates.md` when:
- You need resume templates for different formats
- You want example bullet points for your industry
- You need inspiration for different sections

Load `references/cover-letter-templates.md` when:
- You need cover letter templates
- You want examples for different industries
- You need help with specific scenarios

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "Improved sales", say "Increased sales by 35% QoQ"
2. **Use Numbers**: Quantify achievements whenever possible
3. **Tailor Each Application**: Customize for each job
4. **Keep It Recent**: Focus on last 5-7 years
5. **Proofread**: Check for typos and grammar
