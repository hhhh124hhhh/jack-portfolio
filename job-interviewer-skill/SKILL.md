# Job Interviewer

This skill transforms Codex into a professional interviewer to help users practice and prepare for job interviews.

## What It Does

- **Role-playing**: Acts as a professional interviewer for any position
- **Realistic Q&A**: Asks questions one-by-one and waits for your answers
- **Instant Feedback**: Provides feedback on your responses
- **Flexible Positions**: Works for any job role (software engineer, designer, marketer, etc.)
- **Skill Assessment**: Evaluates your strengths and areas for improvement

## Quick Start

Just tell Codex what position you're interviewing for:

- "I need to practice for a software developer interview"
- "Help me prepare for a product manager interview"
- "Interview me for a marketing specialist role"

Codex will automatically load this skill and start the interview.

## Interview Workflow

1. **Position Setup**: Specify the job title and any specific requirements
2. **Introduction**: Interviewer welcomes you and sets the tone
3. **Q&A Loop**: One question at a time, wait for your answer
4. **Feedback**: Get constructive feedback after each response
5. **Skill Assessment**: Summary of your performance and improvement areas

## Interview Position Examples

The skill works with ANY position. Common examples:

**Tech:**
- Software Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Product Manager
- UX/UI Designer
- DevOps Engineer

**Business:**
- Marketing Manager
- Sales Representative
- Business Analyst
- HR Specialist
- Operations Manager

**Creative:**
- Content Writer
- Graphic Designer
- Video Editor
- Social Media Manager

**Other:**
- Customer Support
- Teacher/Educator
- Consultant
- Researcher

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "manager", say "Product Manager with 3 years experience"
2. **Practice Multiple Times**: Each session will be different
3. **Ask for Feedback**: Request specific feedback on areas you want to improve
4. **Note Patterns**: Learn common interview questions and best practices
5. **Time Yourself**: Practice answering within 2-3 minutes per question

## Advanced Features

After several rounds, you can ask the interviewer to:
- "Increase difficulty" - More challenging questions
- "Focus on behavioral questions" - STAR method questions
- "Test technical skills" - Role-specific technical questions
- "Simulate a panel interview" - Multiple interviewers

## When to Load Reference Files

Load `references/interview-questions.md` when:
- You want to see a curated list of common interview questions
- You're preparing for specific companies (FAANG, startups, etc.)
- You need guidance on answering different question types

Do NOT load reference files during the actual interview - it will break the role-play.

## Limitations

- This is a simulation, not a real interview
- Feedback is based on general best practices, not company-specific
- Technical questions cover general knowledge, not hyper-specialized topics
- Always research the specific company and role for best preparation
